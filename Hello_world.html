    HELLO WORLD!

    Congratulations on starting my web development journey today!!!

    HTML is a great place to start, as it is the foundation of all websites. Once I have a good understanding of HTML, I can move on to learning CSS and JavaScript, which will allow me to add style and interactivity to my websites.
    
    Here is a memento to commemorate this special day:
